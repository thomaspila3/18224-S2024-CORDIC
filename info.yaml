# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "CORDIC rotation and vectoring module"  
  how_it_works: "You can input an angle in radians, or an x,y coordinate to get cosine/sin or atan/length of the vector" 
  how_to_test:  "Code is tested with cocotb testbench cordic_tb.py and with an FPGA. To use an FPGA, set an input, then reset to get the output. Every time there's a change in input, one needs to reset the design"

  inputs:               # a description of what the inputs do
    - mode_toggle # toggles between rotation and vectoring mode
    - out_toggle  # toggles between sin/cosine or atan/vector length
    - in_val[9:0] # 10 bit input vector. Either 10 bit in radians (3 bit decimal, 7 bit fraction) or 2 5-bit fraction x/y coordinates
  outputs:
    - done # indicates whether the design is done calculating
    - val[10:0] # 11 bit output, 2 bit decimal 9 bit fraction
